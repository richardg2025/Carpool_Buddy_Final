IB CSHL Year 12 Semester 2 P-SET: Carpool Buddy

This is an app created in Andriod Studio that allows users to book and share rides. 
It is made to incentivise the people from my school to carpool instead of all take private vehicles.
This is for two reasons:
1. Decrease congestion as there is only one road leading to school
2. Help the enviroment

The code is written in Java.
Kotlin version is not available.
